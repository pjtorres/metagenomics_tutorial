## Docker
What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies together in the form of a docker container to ensure that your application works seamlessly in any environment.

What is Container ?
Docker Container is a standardized unit which can be created on the fly to deploy a particular application or environment. It could be an Ubuntu container, CentOs container, etc. to full-fill the requirement from an operating system point of view. Also, it could be an application oriented container like CakePHP container or a Tomcat-Ubuntu container etc.

Who cares?
Lets say that you want ot get a new  alignment program but this depends on a version of perl which is different than the one you need to run the other half of your pipeline. Should you download both and keep both? Should you erase one. Or what if you build a 'most excellent' pipeline that after weeks of troublkeshooting runs flawlessly on your somputer. SO you are ready to scale up and run it on your universitties cluster. Problem is the cluster has a Centos OS and your stuff was built on the Mac or the cluster has a different version of bowtie than wha tyour prgram needs to run. AS your infrastructure, team, tyopes of datasets, programs used ect.. builds up you can run into dependecy hell. Essentially what can happen with Docker is that I can build the infrastructure I know is needed to run a certain task.
